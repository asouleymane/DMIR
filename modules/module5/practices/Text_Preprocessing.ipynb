    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization in linguistics, is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item. \n",
    "By inflected it means to change the form of a word to express a particular grammatical function or attribute, typically tense, mood, person, number, case, and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational linguistics, lemmatization is the algorithmic process of determining the lemma for a given word. \n",
    "The process may involve complex tasks such as understanding context and determining the part of speech of a word in a sentence requiring, for example, knowledge of the grammar of a language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many languages, words appear in several inflected forms. \n",
    "For example, in English, the verb ‘to walk’ may appear as ‘walk’, ‘walked’, ‘walks’, ‘walking’. \n",
    "The base form, ‘walk’, that one might look up in a dictionary, is called the lemma for the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization is closely related to stemming. \n",
    "The difference is that a stemmer operates on a single word without knowledge of the context, and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech. \n",
    "However, stemmers are typically easier to implement and run faster, and the reduced accuracy may not matter for some applications.\n",
